**Merge request checklist**

- [ ] I read the [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-QueryBuilder/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] I **didn't** commited files in the `dist` directory
- [ ] Unit tests are OK
- [ ] If it's a new feature, I added the necessary unit tests
- [ ] If it's a new language, I filled the `__locale` and `__author` fields
